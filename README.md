# php

In this repository, I use [PHP](https://www.php.net/). I have used it for a while, and I know it well. In this repo I will add small and big projects, which I have done with PHP.

Every branch is a project. I will add some small projects, which I have done with PHP. You can visit different branches, and you can see the codes of the projects.

Some projects which in PHP:

* [x] [studentRegistation](https://github.com/Aniket-git-hub/php/tree/studentRegistation) - This is a small project, which I have done with PHP. It is a simple project, which is used to register students. And shows use of OOP concepts.

* [ ] [LoginSystem](https://github.com/Aniket-git-hub/php/tree/LoginSystem) - This is a small project, which I have done with PHP. It shows use of OOP concepts, and use of database, and use of sessions, and use of cookies.

Later I will add many projects, for the time being, I will add only small projects.
