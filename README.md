# Student Registration System In PHP

In this project we have created a form in HTML which takes students detials and sends that data to the php server. There the data is stored in a DB table.

```

Or you install xampp and then install the packages. To install xampp, you need to download the [installer](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.2.0/xampp-win32-1.8.0-0-VC15-installer.exe).
